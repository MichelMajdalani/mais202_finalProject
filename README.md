        2. Recommended dataset to use (447 scholarly articles cite this dataset)
        
2. Methodology <br />
   1. _Data preprocessing_: Analyze features with histograms and heat maps. Since the data set is small (less than 600 rows), I do not need to PCA. I will follow most of what the following URL recommends: https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/feature-selection-and-data-visualization.
   2. _Machine Learning model_: The objective of this project is to predict whether the cancer is benign or malignant. From my research, its seems that Random Forest, Decision tree and SVM gave good results of around 99% accuracy. 
   3. _Final conceptualization_: Simple web page where you manually enter features of a cell and it predicts whether or not it is malignant or benign.
